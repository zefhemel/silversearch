# Silversearch

Silversearch is a plug for [Silverbullet](https://silverbullet.md/) implementing full-text search across your space, with the goal of maximum usability out of the box. It's *heavily* based on code from [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) (so give this guy a star not me) and as a consequence also uses [Minisearch](https://github.com/lucaong/minisearch) under the hood. When combined with other plugs it can not only search through your markdown files, but also search inside any document, like pdfs or images.

## Installation

The plug is installed like any other plug using SpaceLua. Just add `"ghr:MrMugame/silversearch"` to the `plugs` array on your `CONFIG` page.
```lua
config.set {
  plugs = {
    "ghr:MrMugame/silversearch"
  }
}
```
Then, run the `Plugs: Update` update command to download and install the plug.

## Usage

You can open the search dialog using the `Silversearch: Search` command (`Ctrl-s`/`Cmd-s`). Simply start typing to begin your search, helpful tips for refining your searches will appear at the start. If Silversearch is missing the most up-to-date content, you can rebuild the search database using the `Silversearch: Reindex` command. If you rebuild Silverbullets index, Silversearch will also rebuild, so there is no need to run both commands.

Indexing for documents isn't handled by Silversearch, but by other plugs or Space Lua. You can install the following plugs to index specific documents.

- [Silverbullet PDF](https://github.com/MrMugame/silverbullet-pdf): Will index text content from PDFs using PDF.js

If you are missing something and want to write your own indexer, you can look into the [API](#API) section.

## Settings

Silversearch can be configured using SpaceLua
```lua
config.set {
  silversearch = {
    -- Weighs specific fields more
    weights = {
      basename = 15
      -- Also available: tags, aliases, directory, displayName, content
    },
    -- Weighs pages with specific attributes set through frontmatter more if that attribute is included in the search
    weightCustomProperties = {
      books = 10
    },
    -- Files that have been edited more recently than, will be weighed more. Options are "day", "week", "month" or "disabled"
    recencyBoost = "week",
    -- Rank specific folders down
    downrankedFoldersFilters = {"Library/"},
    -- Normalize diatrics in queries and search terms. Words like "brûlée" or "žluťoučký" will be indexed as "brulee" and "zlutoucky".
    ignoreDiacritics = true,
    -- Similar to `ignoreDiacritics` but for arabic diatritics
    ignoreArabicDiacritics = false,
    -- Breaks urls down into searchable words
    tokenizeUrls = true,
    -- Breaks words seperated with camel case into searchable words
    splitCamelCase = true,
    -- Increases the fuzziness of the full-text search, options are "0", "1", "2"
    fuzziness = "1",
    -- Puts newlines into the excerpts as opposed to rendering it as one continous string
    renderLineReturnInExcerpts = true
  }
}
```

## API

To integrate Silversearch with SpaceLua, use the following syscalls:

- `silversearch.search(searchTerm: string, singleFilePath?: string): Promise<ResultPage[]>`: Searches the database using the `searchTerm`, which supports all functions the normal search also supports (e.g. `ext`, etc.). If `singleFilePath` is provided it will only search the provided file. The function will return an array of [`ResultPage`](https://github.com/MrMugame/silversearch/blob/5c4a3b57a8f92336c5e2b1ae29ff9d4b668cd470/shared/global.ts#L6)
- `silversearch.openSearch(defaultQuery: string = ""): void`: This opens the search modal. If a default query is provided it will be inserted into the search field.
- `silversearch.reindex(): void`: Rebuilds the search database.

When Silversearch indexes a document, it will fire the `silversearch:index` event to query the content. SpaceLua or plugs can respond with content. If nobody responds, the document won't be indexed. If multiple listeners respond, an error will be thrown and the document also won't be indexed. The return type for listeners looks like this

```ts
type ExtractionResult = {
  // The document content as a string, this should be fairly straightforward
  content: string:
  // If a document took a lot of processing power to generate, it makes
  // sense to store it across reloads. The default is "session"
  cacheMode?: "persistent" | "session";
  // This type is defined in shared/global.ts. It's used to map an offset in
  // the document content to a link tail (i.e `@42`, `#foo`). If a document
  // viewer implements navigation based on that, it can navigate the offset of
  // a search result to the correct place.
  navigationMap?: NavigationMap;
};
```
